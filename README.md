Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game that is played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to place three of your marks (X or O) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row, while preventing your opponent from doing the same.

To play the game, players take turns placing their marks on an empty square on the grid. The first player to achieve a row of three marks wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has achieved a row of three marks, the game ends in a tie.

This implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe allows two human players to play against each other. Players can select their mark (X or O) at the start of the game. The game board is displayed after each move, and the game ends when a player wins or the game is tied.

I also turn of the player and reset button so that you are able to reset the game anytime you want in the middle of the game.

If player X wins the game the result is:
